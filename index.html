<p>5 Recipes That Are a Sure Thing in an Uncertain Time</p>

<p> Started as a response to the pandemic, Melissa Clark’s From the Pantry series says goodbye.</p>


<p>
    Back in March, during those first terrifying weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, 
    I started writing a series of articles as a way to help cooks figure out how to
    use the mountain of beans and pasta many of us had manically laid in, in case we couldn’t, 
    or didn’t feel comfortable, leaving the house.head - includes the page title, meta tags, 
    redirects, language <br>

    Called From the Pantry, it was intended to provide recipes that were versatile enough to 
    cut down on anxiety-ridden trips to the supermarket, while still being satisfying to eat 
    and calming to cook. The recipes, written narratively, were a real-time kitchen diary, 
    based on what I had in my own pantry, and created with an eye toward giving readers wiggle 
    room to use what was in theirs. <br>
